# Project Todos

This week's assignment was to build a todo list using Redux.

## The problem

I started out by thinking about the design. I decided to work with a vintage, floral theme and spent some time picking out a background image and deciding on a color scheme. I continued by creating the components, adding a text input, a submit button, checkboxes and a button to clear all tasks. I also added an icon for removing individual tasks.

If I had more time I would have added some extra features.

Technologies: CSS3, JSX, React, Redux.
